# Implementing Authentication in a nodejs Application using Passport js

There are several ways to implement authentication in Node.js applications, including:

- **Session-based authentication**: This involves creating a session for a user after they have successfully authenticated, and then using this session to maintain the user's authentication status throughout their session. Session-based authentication typically uses cookies or tokens to store session information.

- **Token-based authentication**: This involves issuing a unique token to a user after they have successfully authenticated, and then requiring this token to be sent with every subsequent request in order to access protected resources. Token-based authentication is often used in RESTful APIs, and it is commonly implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).

- **OAuth-based authentication**: This involves using the OAuth protocol to authenticate users against third-party providers such as Google or Facebook. OAuth-based authentication can simplify the authentication process for users by allowing them to log in with their existing social media accounts, and it can also provide a more secure authentication mechanism than traditional username/password authentication.

- Overall, authentication is an important aspect of building secure Node.js applications, and developers should carefully consider their authentication approach based on the requirements of their application and the sensitivity of the data they are protecting.We'll learn about these different auth strategies in this project
